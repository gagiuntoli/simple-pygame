# 2D Multiplayer Game

This game was designed for the Udemy course: **Build a 2d multiplayer game with
PyGame**. This is 2D multiplayer game where each player has assigned a point
with a particular color and each player can control the velocity angle of his
point. The point traces a curve as time goes by. The player who survives the
longest without touching or going out of the board wins.

The game includes a quad-tree collision check algorithm (O(ln(n)) which is much
faster than a linear search algorithm (O(n)).

The Udemy course teaches how to build this game step-by-step.
